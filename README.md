# Looking for help: <br>
Since with the newest update I added multi-language support now I need translators for missing languages:<br>
- ro-RO <br>

The task is simple, I just need you to translate 6 lines of text <br>
<a href="https://github.com/Penelopeep/SwitchElementTraveller/blob/Main/src/main/resources/en_US.json">The file to translate is this</a> and translated one send me on discord <b><a href="https://discord.com/users/276265598508466176">Penelopeep#7963</a></b>, or make pull request if you want ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ <br>
You'll be included in this readme<br>
Also, I updated one command and translated it with Google Translator, let me know if it's bad.

# SwitchElement
Simple, mostly stolen script from one of pr in official gc, which allows to quickly change traveller element.<br>
I just changed it to plugin and added multilanguage support. <br>

## Installation
Download the newest release from [releases pages](https://github.com/Penelopeep/SwitchElementTraveller/releases) \
Or download and extract `jar` file from zip in the newest package *(may include functions not available in release package)* from [actions](https://github.com/Penelopeep/SwitchElementTraveller/actions) \
Place `jar` file inside `GrasscutterFolder/Plugins` \
Restart server if it's running already

## Usage
Use <b>/se {element} or /switchelement {element} <constellation number[0-6]></b><br>
Elements: <b>white/anemo/geo/electro/dendro</b> <br>
white = no element <br>
Also you can use alternative names:
- <b>Anemo</b>: Air, Wind
- <b>Cryo</b>: Ice
- <b>Dendro</b>: Grass, Plant
- <b>Geo</b>: Rock
- <b>Hydro</b>: Water
- <b>Pyro</b>: Fire
- <b>White</b>: Common

## Building
I don't know why would you want to build it but:
1. Clone project with `git clone https://github.com/Penelopeep/SwitchElementTraveller.git`
2. Download maven from apache website
3. Open command prompt/powershell in your project folder (Sorry Linux and MacOS users, you'll need to find your own way for this)
4. Run <b>mvn package</b>
5. Now jar file should be in new target folder
